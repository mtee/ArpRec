# ArpRec
ARCore Session Recorder - records poses and the raw camera feed of an ARCore session.
Based on the ARCore's SDK "HelloAR-java" sample and this SO answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/48066599/1641923, although the application in this repo does only record the raw camera feed without virtual objects.
